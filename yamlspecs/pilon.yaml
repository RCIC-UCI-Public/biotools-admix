  description: |
    Pilon is a software tool which can be used to
    (1) Automatically improve draft assemblies
    (2) Find variation among strains, including large event detection
    Pilon requires as input a FASTA file of the genome along with one or more BAM files 
    of reads aligned to the input FASTA file. Pilon uses read alignment analysis to 
    identify inconsistencies between the input genome and the evidence in the reads.
