  description: |
    Pilon is an automated genome assembly improvement and variant detection tool.
    It can be used to automatically improve draft assemblies and to find variation
    among strains, including large event detection. Pilon requires as input a FASTA
    file of the genome along with one or more BAM files of reads aligned to the
    input FASTA file. Pilon uses read alignment analysis to identify inconsistencies
    between the input genome and the evidence in the reads.
