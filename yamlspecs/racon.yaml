  description: |
    Racon is an ultrafast consensus module for raw de novo genome assembly of long uncorrected reads
    Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct raw contigs generated by rapid 
    assembly methods which do not include a consensus step. Racon takes as input only three files
    (1) contigs in FASTA/FASTQ format, (2) reads in FASTA/FASTQ format and (3) overlaps/alignments 
    between the reads and the contigs in MHAP/PAF/SAM format. Output is a set of polished contigs 
    in FASTA format printed to stdout. A wrapper script is also available to enable easier usage 
    to the end-user for large datasets.
