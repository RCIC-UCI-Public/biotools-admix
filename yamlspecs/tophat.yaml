  description: |
    TopHat {{version}}. TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq
    reads. It aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the 
    ultra high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes 
    the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons
