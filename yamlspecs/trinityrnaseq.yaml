  description: |
    Trinity {{version}}, developed at the Broad Institute and the Hebrew University 
    of Jerusalem, represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo 
    reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three 
    independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied 
    sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions 
    the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing 
    the transcriptional complexity at a given gene or locus, and then processes 
    each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease 
    apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.
