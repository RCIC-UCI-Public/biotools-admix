  description: |
    breseq version {{version}} is a computational pipeline for the analysis of 
    short-read re-sequencing data (e.g. Illumina, 454, IonTorrent, etc.). 
    It uses reference-based alignment approaches to predict mutations in a 
    sample relative to an already sequenced genome. breseq is intended for microbial 
    genomes (<10 Mb) and re-sequenced samples that are only slightly diverged from the
    reference sequence (<1 mutation per 1000 bp).
