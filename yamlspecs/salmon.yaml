  description: |
    Salmon version {{version}} is a wicked-fast program to produce a highly-accurate, transcript-level 
    quantification estimates from RNA-seq data. Salmon achieves its accuracy and speed via a number of 
    different innovations, including the use of quasi-mapping (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for 
    traditional read alignments), and massively-parallel stochastic collapsed variational inference. 
    The result is a versatile tool that fits nicely into many different pipelines. For example, you can 
    choose to make use of our quasi-mapping algorithm by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or, 
    if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. an unsorted BAM file 
    produced with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same wicked-fast, state-of-the-art 
    inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment
