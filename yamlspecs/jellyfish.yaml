  description: |
    Jellyfish {{version}} is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in DNA. 
    A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences of all such 
    substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA sequence. Jellyfish can count k-mers 
    using an order of magnitude less memory and an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer 
    counting packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by exploiting the 
    'compare-and-swap' CPU instruction to increase parallelism.
